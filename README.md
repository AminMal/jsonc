# jsonc #
jsonc is a JSON converter that can convert any kind of JSON document into structs/classes of programming languages.

There might be some occasions where you have a JSON document and you want to model it in a programming language.

You don't want to do it manually, `jsonc` is a lightweight cli application that can do this for you.

-----
## Files ##
There are two ways you can use `jsonc` with files:

* Providing filepath:
    ```sh
    jsonc -l rust filepath
    ```
* Using OS pipe:
    ```sh
    cat filepath | jsonc -l go
    ```

## APIs ##
```sh
curl http://something.com/api/v1/some_resource | jsonc -l go
```

-----
The above commands will just print the result to standard output, you probably need to copy the content into your clipboard.
you can use `pbcopy` on UNIX systems to do so:
```sh 
jsonc -l scala filepath | pbcopy
```

Here's an example of how it works, given a json document in `filepath`, as:
```json
{"name":"John","last_name":       "Doe", "age":21}
```
Executing:
```sh 
cat filepath | jsonc -l java
```
Would produce:
```java
public class AutoGenerated {
	public Integer age;
	public String lastName;
	public String name;
}
```
